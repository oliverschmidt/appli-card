# Appli-Card

This project is based on [A2Pico](https://github.com/oliverschmidt/a2pico).

With this firmware, the A2Pico emulates a [PCPI Appli-Card](https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/Interface%20Cards/Z80%20Cards/PCPI%20Appli-Card/) that contains a Z80 CPU and enables CP/M operation.
